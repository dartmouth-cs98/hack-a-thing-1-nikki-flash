This is a barebones IOS app created with the aid of the official IOS/Swift tutorial, found here: 
  https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/
  
The app is called Food Reviewer (Food Tracker in the tutorial), and allows the user to keep a record of the meals
  they have eaten, as well as a rating and a picture. It supports the following functionalities:
  
  Creating, Deleting, and Editing a Meal.
  Viewing the meals in a table in the app home screen.
  Storing the meals to memory and retrieving them when the app is closed and re-opened.
  
The current default meals are examples of Indian Food, and the current default New Meal image is my grandfather,
  who is often hungry and is eagerly awaiting the meal you are about to present to him.
  
I worked on my own on this project. I briefly discussed with Adam Rinehouse yesterday on how outdated the tutorial was, 
  as we completed the same one.
